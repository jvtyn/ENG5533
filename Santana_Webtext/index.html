<h1>Literacy Sponsorship and the Streaming Service</h1>
<p>Currently, most of us use streaming services to access our music. Instead of purchasing singles and albums directly, streaming services offer free music or an annual subscription that provides an endless amount of music at the tip of your fingers. These websites are known as "Platforms" and offer artists exposure for their creative content. In result, these services can be seen as modern sort of literacy sponsorship. Music platforms certainly fit Deborah Brandt's defintion of a literacy sponsor which can be described as, "recognizing agents, local or distant, concrete or abstract, who enable, support, teach, model, as well as recruit, regulate, suppress, or withhold literacy". They collect a large amount of revenue from their community while giving artists only a small piece. It's interesting to use her definition when we think about the goal of this platform. Exposure is always the common goal for artists but for the platform itself we can use the contractual "Terms of Use" to better understand how artists are being exploited. </p>

<p>If Brandt suggests that the evolution of publishing literacy is connected to literacy as an economic development, it is worth looking into what the streaming services gain from these artists who are so eager to succeed. Soundcloud in particular has a reputation for being a platform that has remained free for a long time. Until recently, Soundcloud had remained ad free allowing it to be a hub for genres like underground rap. The African American community has personally influenced such popular genres on this platform and continue to be the ones who support it. The Nielsen company offers data on who is using these platforms. They suggest, "African-Americans are more likely than the total market to have a paid subscription to an online music streaming service." Choosing to market exposure to such influential groups has allowed Soundcloud to reach a high level of success. So now that Soundcloud offers premium subscriptions to members, there are more questions regarding how the streams are being monetized for artists. </p>

<p>At the moment, for paid registered artists or users of Soundcloud's "Pro Accounts" there is a seperate "Terms of Use" section that covers the payment for streams. However, this seperate contract is only available after you purchase it. After digging around on the site it seemed pretty clear. If you do not pay for the Soundcloud Premier option, you will not get paid for your music streams. Within this membership, artists must sign a monetization agreement. This is where the "Creator's Guide" can be found, which briefly explains how to monetize your work. In this guide it is simply stated: "You will receive a share of revenue based on plays in eligible countries." Yet, beyond this small statement there is no information on a real breakdown of these streams. </p>

<p>To better understand the Creators Guide and decipher the "share of revenue" I've asked Deshon Jones to help me look through the many contracts that Soundcloud offers. Deshon is a local artist that uses Soundcloud and other platforms to share his work with the community. He writes and performs under the name "LyMerrick" and is based here in Kansas City, Missouri. Additionally, we will discuss the history of music streaming and it's appeal to artists around the world.</p>

<p>Streaming has truly revolutionalized the music industry. While it is convienent, the day we decided to listen to recorded music through a service almost everyone in the business lost revenue. "When the popularity of unlicensed file-sharing caused a rapid decline in sales of recorded music starting in the late 1990s, songwriters, publishers, recording artists, and record labels hoped to replace these lost revenues with licensing fees from digital streaming services." As it developed, copyright law became increasingly harder to regulate and these platforms had little restriction until the Music Modernization Act in 2018. As a result, the blanket royalty rates that were granted are meant to be shared as suggested in Soundcloud's Creators Guide. While Soundcloud uses a shared revenue model to pay their artists, creators only get about 55 percent of net revenue on their songs.</p>

<p>Prior to the Music Modernization Act, Soundcloud only monetized streams through subscriptions on an invite-only basis. When the act pushed copyright owners to claim royalities, the Terms of Use changed.</p>

<p>This is where I want to leave room for my discussion with Deshon. His knowledge of the music industry will allow me to better understand how to combat the exploitation within services like Soundcloud. Additionally, we will discuss alternative options to publishing your music that better benefits the artist.</p>
