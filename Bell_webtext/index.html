    <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In the mental health world, writing is used to address an array of emotional trauma where a patient writes about the trauma-inducing event everyday for 20 minutes (De Schutter 699).  In the business arena, a two-fold approach to closing the “justice gap” is gaining popularity.  First, the organization removes the injustice, and then, the organization helps the employee heal from the injustice through the vehicle of expressive writing (Barclay 701).  In academia, however, the healing administration of writing is discouraged when it comes to African American students, many of whom, according to William Wan in the article, “Racism has devastating effects on children’s health, periatiricians warn” experience adverse emotional and even physical repurcussions of daily racial discrimination (Wan 1).  Research also reveals that black dialect speaking students who haven’t mastered speaking standard dialect by 4th grade perform one grade level lower than black dialect speaking students who have (Washington 2-3) .  This is the baseline for the existing achievement gap between white students and African American students in the public education system.  Linguistic Injustice is defined as a form of prejudice in which people hold implicit judgements about a person based on the way the person speaks (Hao 1).  As in the case of the clinical world and the workplace, I believe that the elimination of linguistic injustice in language classes, specifically Creative Writing classes, will not only help close the achievement gap but promote the socio-psychological health of African American students.</p>

<h1>Linguistic Injustice</h1>
<p>Linguistic Injustice, which is a form of prejudice in which people hold implicit judgements about a person based on the way the person speaks, usually manifests in one of two ways: Through the exercise of Eternal Restrictions or through the employment of Internal Restrictions (De Schutter 1035).  In External Restrictions, the language rights of one group infringes on the realization of equal language rights of another.  For example, a school district only recognizes one English dialect in a region of diverse dialect-speaking students.  With Internal Restrictions, the language rights of one group infringes on the realization of equal rights of some members in the same group.  For instance, a school does not allow a group of students to learn a different language.  Will Kymlicka points out that both restrictions, in an attempt to protect traditions and religious attributions, actually inhibit the natural evolution of a society (1036).  On the other hand, linguistic justice postulates both language recognition and language perseverance, two attributes of a highly developing and thriving nation.  Simply put, To subjugate a language in a nation is to subjugate the people of that language, and to kill a language in a nation is to kill the people of the language. Thus, the ongoing debate in the United States, Belgium, Canada, France and Switzerland has been, not if, but how should language identities be politically recognized (De Schutter 1035)?
    Presently, there are two systems for governing language diversity: Linguistic Territoriality (LT) and Linguistic Pluralism (LP).  LT only recognizes the dialect spoken by the dominant group within a territory while ignoring the other dialects.  LP allocates equal recognition and support for all English dialects within a territory (1036). There is a sect of LP supporters, however, who are in favor of external protections to safeguard the cultural equality of the inner group from that of an outside group.  In the case of the United States of America, English is recognized as the primary language yet there are millions of English dialect-speaking students attending the public school system where LT is the governing system, but the question must be, “Is LT Linguistic Justice?”

    <h1>Linguistic Territoriality and External Restrictions in English Language Arts and Creative Writing Classes</h1>
    <p>In the Kansas City Public School System, where 85% of the student body are possibly dialect-speaking students, LT and External Restrictions are the norm (www.kcpublicschools.org/domain/98).  However, a more just approach would be to govern language diversity employing LT in the community, without restrictions in the compulsory education system, in particular English Language Arts classrooms and the Creative Writing classrooms.  LT is unjust for the following reasons: It fosters a continuation of the existing achievement gap, and it also abuses the purpose of self-expression, creativity and regeneration in the Creative Writing classroom.
        LT without restrictions within English Language Arts classes would be done in the form of teaching “Code Switching,” a practice of alternating between two or more languages or varieties of language in conversation/writing depending on the setting.  At a fast food restaurant, President Obama, who usually speaks a standard dialect in formal settings, code switches when he tells the cashier, “Naw, we straight” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-lYueJivk&feature=youtu.be.).
        Contrary to public backlash in the past, Linguists like Julie Washington believe that black dialect is not only a huge contributing factor to the achievement gap but that students need to learn what type of dialect to use in various situations.  Washington points out that even though code switching can be learned without the help of classroom instruction, some dialect speaking students learn to code-switch later than sooner, if at all.  In order to reap the full benefits of code switching, it must become a part of classroom instruction (3-4). 
        Code switching can be taught in one of two ways: the Correctionist way or the Contrastivist way. The Correctionist way is when a teacher makes it clear that standard dialect is the only acceptable form of English in the classroom. As discussed earlier, the Correctionist approach would constitute LT with restrictions, and this approach is definitely linguistic injustice. The Contrastivist method, on the other hand, is when a teacher communicates that both standard dialect and black dialect are a part of the student’s individuality.  Coffey claims that the LP Contrastivist approach is more conducive to a learning environment and paints the following picture (Partners in Learning 3-4):
        The teacher communicates with a child through an understanding lense. 
        The teacher knows that language comes in diverse varieties. The teacher also 
        places importance on a child’s home language and helps the child to 
        become aware of the changes they can make to their language to stand 
        grammatically correct when speaking proper standard English. The student
        will learn how to code-switch from home to school and the difference of
         contexts for each language.
        The LP Contrastivist approach within the Creative Writing class would be done in the form of 1.) analyzing multicultural literature, some of which embodies black dialect and 2.) permitting the use of black dialect in the creation of original works without logistical limitations, that is only using black dialect in small proportion and/or in the development of negative character traits.  In Dialect and Dichotomy: Literary Representations of African American Speech, Minnick argues that the study of black dialect in literature, which inevitably includes decoding, actually offers students a chance to go deeper in literary analysis than that of an average English Language Arts classroom (Schneider 13).  Students of black dialect in literature would study the relationship between linguistic and character development, history, feminism, politics, culture, literary devices and/or a student’s experience (27).  Decoding is the ability to apply one’s knowledge of letter-sound relationships, including knowledge of letter patterns, to correctly pronounce written words. The correlation between the development of the art and the appreciation of the art is that because black dialect is often viewed as an inferior dialect to use in the development of stories/poems, the necessary decoding in reading multicultural literature is viewed as a nuisance by the general public.  In fact, the works of writers like Paul Laurence Dunbar and Zora Neale Hurston who used black dialect in the creation of their works were harshly criticised by white literary critics (Schneider 14).  It wasn’t until 1896 when respected writer/editor William Dean Howell wrote an applauding review that Paul Laurence Dunbar became a respected “man of letters” (Adams 2).  Unfortunately, the stigmatism of using black dialect still exists today.  Writer Arriel Vinson bears witness in “Black Language Shouldn’t Have to Be Muted for White Readers”:
        Writers of color are always told -- not asked -- to center and consider whiteness every time we write. To think about what kind of language white people enjoy reading, how much (or little) they’ll want to work to understand an experience besides their own, and how much push back we’ll get if we continuously write about race. As a black writer, I am told to do the work for the readers. I am told that AAVE [African American Vernacular English) needs to be muted so as to not overshadow the one language that matters to white people. I am told to make black experiences white ones instead, or at least experiences that are written in a language they find comfortable. I am asked to forget about the black girls and boys I write for, and instead, write for an audience that already has a spread of white writers to choose from. (4)
        Arriel Vinson also proclaims a truth that linguistic injustice in the Creative Writing classroom has long denied: African American Vernacular English [or black dialect] isn’t a marker of low intelligence; if anything, it’s the opposite. To navigate both AAVE and “proper” English is an intellectual act in itself (3).”

    <h1>The Rich Linguistic History of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) Black Dialect</h1>
    <p>In order to teach a creative writing curriculum free from linguistic injustice, one must uncover the rich linguistic history of AAVE which inevitably includes an in-depth study of both the language lexicon and African American history.  For starters, a common practice of slave traders during the American Slave Trade was to separate slaves who spoke a common language in order to diminish the chances of a revolt. This was also practiced in the slave ports of West Africa.  Not one African language survived this linguistic segregation fully intact.  Consequently, a pidgin language surfaced that maintained some phrases and lexical items of its African parent languages.  For instance, the Carolina’s Gullah Geechee Creole language which derived from Pidgin still uses words from West African countries. The word “bobo” means “boy” in Gullah Geechee, Ghana and Sierra Leone.  The words “dayclean” and “coota” mean “dawn” and “turtle” in Gullah Geechee and Jamaican (Daise https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuWRaWGVNl)..  According to Viveka Velupillai, It usually takes a pidgin language seven or more generations to develop into a separate language; however, the pidgin language of African slaves rapidly evolved into a sophisticated language of Creole in only three generations because African slaves were not taught to read or write English when they arrived in America ().  
        After slavery ended, Creole eventually developed  into AAVE, a dialect that was preserved by through Segregation and Jim Crow Era of 1877-1950s.  Once segregation ended in 1954, the white general public viewed AAVE as an inferior language spoken by lazy and ignorant people.  As a result, many African American students have been misdiagnosed and placed in remedial classes simply because they speak the dialect of their home while African American student-writers are discouraged and/or limited using black dialect  in their original creations ().  Professor Geneva Smitherman has rejected such racist ideology by emphasizing that AAVE is a dialect spoken by slave descendants who were brought to North America with force and who had to learn English without the help of education.  Linguists have also been able to show how AAVE is a quasiforeign language, a systematic rule-governed dialect of Standard dialect of English.

<h1>Results and Analysis of Implimentation of Creative Writing Pedagogy</h1>
<p>The curriculum was implemented with an online Creative Writing class during the COVID-19 pandemic. The class consists of thirteen students; one boy and twelve girls, ranging from 9th grade to 12th grade.  All of whom are of African-American descent and speak AAVE and a Standard dialect of English.  
    The introduction of the class was an activity that instructed students to read two language samples which included a page of "The Story of an Hour" by Kate Chopin and a page of Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston.  The students were then asked to use the drawing tool function in Google classroom to create images, cartoons, and/or characters that reflected each language sample.  Many of the images for Language Sample#1 contained a combination of Afrocentric images of struggle, hope/love while Language Sample #2 images consisted of property, wealth, love and happiness:

    Next, the Creative Writing students were instructed to write a reflection/response of at least 5 sentences expressing their thoughts behind the images they created. They were also instructed to respond to the reflection/response of at least two other students. As expected, this initiated a discussion about language and race identity. With the speakers of both language samples being women, one black and one white, the discussion surprisingly included revealing perceptions the students held about language and feminism.  Below is a snapshot of the words/phrases used by several students during our online discussion:

    LANGUAGE SAMPLE #1: AAVE
    LANGUAGE SAMPLE #2: Standard Dialect of English
    freedom
    mansion
    slavery
    women wearing long ruffled dresses
    Broken chains
    proper
    black
    sophisticated
    Country dialect
    Submissive women
    African American
    wives
    Southern
    Husbands with status and power
    Independence
    Comfortable lifestyles
    Dark skin 
    hair
    stereotypes
    Masculine,  independent  women
    hoe
    
    As one can see, the Creative Writing students had formed both positive and negative perceptions of their own language and femininity associating AAVE speaking females with strength, masculinity and even whoredom and Standard English dialect speaking women with marriage, love, submission and wealth.  The students were not aware of the objective behind the activity until I shared the chart with them.  Continuing with the curriculum,  I then invited them to watch a video of John Baugh’s experiment Linguistic Profiling, African American English Origin, Gullah. I ended the introduction aspect of the curriculum by informing the students that we would continue with  learning the evolution of AAVE and discussing their experiences with code-switching. They were attentive throughout the entire introduction which for this social group is a good sign.

<div id="Conclusion">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Due to the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, I was late implementing the curriculum and progress has been slow.  What I could have covered in one class session in the school building now takes about one week online.  With things going at such a slow pace, I definitely will not be able to get through one full unit by the time my Alpha Project is due.  
    On the positive side, I have learned so much researching  linguistics and African American literature/history.  Many of the reading selections I surveyed and decided to include in my curriculum I hadn’t read prior to my Alpha Project, and although I haven’t gotten very far in my implementation, I’ve already had to modify the curriculum, covering some material sooner and picking which reading selections actually to cover. Though It wasn’t planned, the wealth of literature I included in the curriculum makes it adaptable for classes of varying demographics in the future.  As a matter of fact, that is my plan:  to continue building on this foundation I’ve established in completing this Alpha Project by learning more about linguistics and African American literature/history so that I can use it to change the world, one classroom at a time.
