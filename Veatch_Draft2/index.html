    <h1>Native American Literacy: A look at Native American Creative Writing and Its Place in American Academic Institutions</h1>
        <h1 id="Intro">Introduction</h1>   
        <p>Indigenous Peoples’ literacies have been underrepresented in the academic world in the past, to the point of inexistence. This research came out of my own acknowledgement of that underrepresentation. I realized that as a member of the academic institution in America, I had little exposure to Native American literature. Furthermore, the exposure I did have with Native American literature had a small role in my academic understanding of literacy. With the expanding view of literacy forms, unacknowledging literacies of Indigenous groups in America is a disservice to those groups and to our understanding of literacy history and learning. Native groups held, and still hold, to strong traditions of oral literacies in the form of storytelling and history.</p>
            <p>Today, those oral literacies have transformed into written literacies. These written literacies often take the form of creative writing which blends traditions of oral literacy with written literacy. For Indigenous groups in America, creative writing was a way for them to bridge the gap between Native cultures and American academics. The introduction of and popularity of Native American Literature gave power, authority, and voice to indigenous groups into an area where they were voiceless. Recently, more studies and recovery projects have been done to draw awareness to the issues surrounding teaching Native American Literature through the white gaze[1], and to integrate more Native American Literature appropriately into academic areas of American society. This research will cover a brief history of Native American literacy history before discussing Native American Literature courses and the changes needed to for these courses to have appropriate and authentic representation of Native American literacy. It is not my intention to provide a comprehensive history of Native American literature and literacy, but rather form an argument on how creative writing outlets gave literacy validation to Indigenous groups in American, and this validation needs to be carried into American academics in order to perpetuate a cycle of appropriate representation of Native American literacy for American students. </p>
        <h1 id="Boarding Schools">Boarding Schools for Indigenous Peoples</h1>
            <p>In the late nineteenth century and continuing into the twentieth century, the United States government and churches created what are called ‘Native American Boarding Schools.’ The sole purpose of these boarding schools was to assimilate Native American children into Western culture. Boarding schools would strip Native American children of their cultural traditions by forcing them to dress, act, and learn Western values. On many occasions, the process of assimilation included degrading remarks from the instructors on the students and their culture. On the “Native Words, Native Warriors” page dedicated to Native American involvement in World War II, there is a page specifically mentioning the “Boarding School Tragedy.” The page goes on to briefly mention what assimilate looked like at these boarding schools, only taking three sentences to mention the positive outcomes of the institutions [americanindian.si.edu]. <p>Another section here with documentary video of boarding schools</p>
            <p>However, Julie Davis, author of “American Indian Boarding School Experiences,” does not understate the irony of those boarding schools. Davis spends her article discussing various books[2] written by those with Native American boarding school experience, or else with ties to one with such experience. She uses her comments to provide focus on the different experiences Native students had in these boarding schools. One “fundamental conclusion” she had was that boarding school histories are ‘complex’ stating,</p>
                <p>Boarding schools embodied both victimization and agency for Native people, and they served as sites of both cultural loss and cultural persistence. These institutions, intended to assimilate Native people into mainstream society and eradicate Native cultures, became integral components of American Indian identities and eventually fueled the drive for political and cultural self-determination in the late twentieth century. (Davis, 20).[3]</p>  
            <p>Indeed, going on Davis describes how although the boarding schools were responsible for the “cultural assault” of Native American children, this assault pushed the children and parents as well as school friends to cleave closer together, thus solidifying familial bonds and traditional values. Students comment that they made lasting friendships at these boarding schools stating that it was “their ties of friendship and loyalty, and the creation of a surrogate family that sustained them in an often hostile environment.” (Davis, 21). Excluding a few instances, many students felt closer to their tribes and other Native students because of the ‘common enemy’ they all had. These dynamics became a ‘us versus them’ situation, one in which the Native students were able to band together and develop stronger relationships with those who shared similar cultural values.</p>
            <p>Another way in which familial bonds grew stronger was through letters parents would write to their children and vice versa. In one section of her article, Davis mentions how cultural assaults would often emerge in the form of banning home visits. She states, “Administrators discouraged visits home, seeing them as threats to assimilation, and this sometimes led to three or four year separations.” (Davis, 21). Yet, these forced separations made letters to and from home all the more necessary and precious for Native families.  Naturally, these letters were a form of written literacy, a Western literacy adoption used against the Western agenda. It is additionally ironic that boarding schools not only worked against their purpose of separating Native children from their tribal cultures, but the literacies learned within the boarding schools would later be used to provide more authority and cultural validation for Native Americans. As Davis says, “…far from eradicating traditional cultures, boarding school experiences actually facilitated cultural persistence in a number of unintended ways.” (Davis, 21). Unintended to be sure, but the combination of oral literacies with written literacies certainly added to the emergence of Native American literature. </p>
        <h1 id="NAL">Emergence of Native American Literature</h1>
            <p>Native American fiction appeared in popularity during the 1930’s, following the Stock Market Crash and the emergence of the most widespread drought in America. As a form of escapism, many entertainers had their start during the Depression Era. Native American writers were no different. Coming out of the Industrial Age in American and the economic boom of the 20’s, American society sought to find solace in forms of entertainment that gave them peace, escape, and hope. Priscilla Oaks, author of “The First Generation of Native American Novelists,” mentions in her article, “As the theme of progress changed to the theme of endurance, the literature of the 1930s turned to the Indian culture and its survival motif.” (Oaks, 58). For Native American writers, heroes were not typical white men, but Native heroes with struggles and enduring characteristics. Instead of a “romantic, epic character,” Native American novels created characters that were often “alienated.” Oaks comments that Native American writers portrayed their Native heroes “realistically.” Such characters were “rebellious” against the “subservient role” given to them by dominant society (Oaks, 60). As opposed to their white foil characters, Native American characters were written with moral integrity and became more than stereotypical token characters for Native American novels. Often, these novels would showcase a hero proud of their ancestry and traditions with the ability to “endure any hardship.” (Oaks, 64).  These characteristics provided hope to readers during a time when endurance was necessary for Americans. Oaks writes, “The Indian became a hero in the fiction of the Depression era and as a result, a genre of Indian literature was formed…” (Oaks, 59). With a new avenue for creative output, Native American writers were able to express their Native traditions and values in a society that previously shunned and stunted those values. While many writers struggled, other creative writers focused on the humanity and endurance of Native heroes and were successful in “bridging the void between the white culture and the red during a time of national crisis” resulting in the “recognition for the values of American Indian life previously suppressed and denied.” (Oaks, 64). As Annette Portillo stated in her article over teaching Native American Literature, “…Native American history is not simply a story of victimization, but rather a story about survival, resistance, transformation, and healing.” (Portillo, 160). It is interesting to note that the Native American identity of endurance grew out of that generations’ experience with Native American boarding schools. And yet these creative writers told stories that acknowledged hardship but showed heroes that prevailed through that hardship with traditional Native American solutions and characteristics. Such stories were not commentaries of Native American tribulation, but rather Native American success through tribulation. </p>
           <p>[Correlation between influx of NA creative writing and Western genre]
            [question: is there a correlation between the influx of NA creative writing and Hollywood’s Western golden era? [Oaks footnote]]
            </p>
            <p>It was called the ‘Renaissance’ of Native American Literature. In the 1970’s a spring of creative writing was published by Native American authors. This was a second wave of Native American fiction writers. Unlike the emergence of Native American fiction in the 1930’s, by the 60’s and 70’s, Native American fiction already had a genre. And by this time, the genre had been influenced by white writers and the American Western genre. Writing about Native Americans was common for many Western writers. Patrice Hollrah in her article, “Sherman Alexie’s Challenge to the Academy’s Teaching of Native American Literature” quotes Alexie’s argument against non-Native writers writing about Native American cultures. Hollrah quotes, “Most non-Indians who write about Indians are fiction writers. Fiction about Indians sells.” (One Stick Song, 22).” (Hollrah, 31). However it isn’t only undue profits non-Native writers make based on stereotyped Native characters that Alexie has a problem with. Hollrah also quotes from an online interview with Alexie,</p> 
            <p>‘Indians rarely get to define our own image, and when white people do it, they often get assigned all this authority, and I guess that’s what my problem is, that Indians are never even allowed the authority to self-define.’ (Barnes & Noble.com 2). (Hollrah, 31).</p>
            <p>Native groups have been a people who have been consistently stripped of their ability and authority to self-define and creative writing had been an area that has helped them bridge the gap between Native American identity and the American identity. Yet, that authority has been taken away by the portrayal of Native people in novels written by white authors. In his argument, Alexie objects to whites writing about Native Americans, from a Native perspective, because they do not have an authentic Native perspective to write from. However, with the rebirth of Native American fiction, creative writers took back the reigns of Native American fiction and told their own stories of the Native identity.</p>

        <h1 id="NAL Courses">Native American Literature Courses</h1>
           <p>Native American Literature courses have had a space in academics for several decades, either in the form of ‘Ethnic Literature’ or ‘Native American Literature.’ However, many of these courses have been deemed inappropriate by Native Americans or members of the Indigenous communities in North America because of the misunderstanding and offensive tones and/or stereotypes often present in such courses. Joseph Bruchac, an Abenaki descendent and professor of ethnic literature, started teaching NAL in 1970 in New York. In his article, “Four Directions: Some Thoughts on Teaching Native American Literature,” Bruchac describes the elements of NAL that he finds problematic. In describing a conversation he had with other professors teaching NAL he wrote, </p>
           <p>One of the people said that he was having a hard time finding texts. Another said that…he had some misgiving about the accuracy of the translations, though he didn’t know enough to know for sure how good they were. The third teacher…mentioned taking a course in how to teach Native American literature from a certain professor…the few Native American students on campus had signed up for the course but all dropped it because they found something objectionable about it. No one knew what. (Bruchac, 3)</p>
           <p>This passage holds a lot of the root issues Bruchac found in man NAL courses. With the first professor, the difficulty in finding texts could be because there were not many appropriate texts readily available for student use. It could also be that this professor’s difficulties stemmed from the same issues the second professor had: not knowing what a ‘good’ text or ‘bad’ text was. With the last professor, the issue seemed to be with the professor’s attitude, not with their lack of ken. The root cause in all of these instances was that NAL courses were becoming popular in universities, but the professors the universities got to teach the courses were not qualified to teach them. Bruchac also writes, </p>
           <p>The [totality of ‘Native American Literature’] comes out of (in just the area now called the continental United States) more than 400 different languages and distinct cultures….Yet, without any special preparation, without any real grounding in the cultures which produced those many literatures, without any familiarity with the languages from which they were translated…teachers on the university (and even high school) level are expected to teach this ‘native American Literature.’ Not only that, most of those teachers have never visited a Native American community or spoken with a singer Native American. (Bruchac, 4). </p>
           <p>The main issue for Bruchac is that NAL courses were being taught by professors who did not come from a background of Indian studies or Native American culture and were therefore unable to appropriately teach such classes. It was not only their lack of cultural knowledge that made them inappropriate choices for instructors, it was also the fact that they were not knowledgeable in what made the literature they taught appropriate for the course. It is difficult to decide what literature to include on the reading list in any class, much less one that holds multiple literatures from multiple cultures being condensed into one semester course broadly described as ‘Native American Literature.’ It is even more difficult if the one choosing the literature is not well versed in Native American literatures, cultures, or languages.</p>
           <p>Such difficulties were analyzed by Patrice Hollrah in her article, “Sherman Alexie’s Challenge to the Academy’s Teaching of Native American Literature.” In this article, Hollrah uses Alexie’s book, Indian Killer, to analyze Alexie’s commentary on teaching NAL through the protagonist, Marie. In the book Marie argues with her professor over the reading list, first stating that one author’s claims to a Cherokee ancestry were false, and second that the autobiographies listed were co-written by white men (Hollrah, 28). Hollrah claims Marie’s objection is a projection of Alexie’s objection to the literature being taught in NAL courses. Hollrah writes, “the determining factor for a Native American literature reading list is that the text represent an ‘authentic’ Native American perspective, one that only ‘authentic’ Indians can deliver.” (Hollrah, 29). In this case, an appropriate NAL course cannot happen without a reading list of appropriately ‘authentic’ texts told from ‘authentic’ Native American perspectives.</p>
           <p>However, texts are not the only problematic element of NAL university courses. As Annette Portillo states in her article, “Indigenous-Centered Pedagogies,” one of the more prevalent issues she finds in her NAL courses are “students’ unwillingness to move beyond their assumptions about specific disciplines.” (Portillo, 156). Naturally, NAL courses hold multiple dynamics when it comes to teaching: literature, Professors, and students make up these dynamics. It can be difficult to achieve the purpose of any class, teaching students, if students are unwilling to be taught. Thus, Portillo not only gives advice to teachers on how to teach Native American literature, but also how to teach students who are being exposed to Native American literature for the first time. Portillo writes, “…it is no surprise that the majority of students come to class with no background in the course content and unfortunately have only learned about American Indian identity and experience through distorted stereotypes that unfortunately still continue to plague our national collective consciousness.” (Portillo, 158). Portillo states that these stereotypes not only appear as derogatory stereotypes but romanticizes stereotypes can be equally detrimental to American Indian identity and therefore compromise the purpose of NAL courses. Students walking into classes expecting one thing often have difficulty learning an entire new set of values and cultural mores.</p>
           <p>Professor Carol Zitzer-Comfort discusses the specific problem I had while encountering Native American literature in the Academy in her article over teaching Native American Literature courses. In her 2008 article she writes,</p>
           <p>While much has been written about teaching Native American literature, a majority of students come to postsecondary American Indian literature courses with a dearth of prior knowledge about native worldviews, tribal diversity, and myths and themes that appear in much of the literature...It is all too apparent that most students are graduating high school and beginning college with little or no exposure to American Indian literature. (Zitzer-Comfort, 160).</p>
           <p>Indeed, Zitzer-Comfort hits the proverbial nail on the head with this observation. She attributes this lack of representation to a lack of Native American demographics[4] in universities, and therefore a lack of courses dedicated to the study of Native American culture. Unless the course is specified as a Native American specific course, most Native American cultural classes are categorized within a broader course: Ethnic studies. True to my situation, the few instances I was exposed to Native American literature was in broader categorized classes[5]. I scarcely remember studying any Native American literature in my Advanced Placement English courses in high school and was therefore unprepared to read Native American literature in college, much less understand their cultural traditions and values. Although this may not be the fault of my professors, as the courses they taught succeeded in their purposes, looking back it seems a disservice to not represent a largely influential literacy culture in America within a literacy-heavy course degree track. Zitzer-Comfort goes on to write,</p>
        <p>The students were much better prepared to discuss African American literature and had in fact already read some of the major African American authors[6]…; yet, with one or two exceptions, none of the students had read Paula Gunn Allen, James Welch, Ella Deloria, Sherman Alexie, Leslie Marmon Silko, N. Scott Momaday, Louise Erdrich, or Joy Harjo.(Zitzer-Comfort, 161). </p>
        <p>Again, this circumstance could be attributed to the demographic I mentioned above. There are simply more African American students in universities than Native American students, and therefore universities feel it necessary to represent mass demographics within the courses offered. While I do not disagree that African American studies is necessary for universities, I also do not disagree with Zitzer-Comfort in saying that Native American studies are equally necessary for universities. Literature being taught as part of the degree track for English degrees are chosen carefully by faculty to highlight literacies, cultures, and in most cases, ‘necessity’ in terms of influence within the greater understanding and conversation of Literature[7]. In America, African American literatures are being taught more frequently as a result of their rich cultural perspectives, influence on American history, and the push-back against the Canon[8] in American academics and society. While the African American community became more vocal literarily, the Native American community is still feeling the forced muteness on their cultural literacies within American academics. Native American cultures have no less influence on American society and history than Western cultures and African American cultures, and yet they have not yet received their share of representation within the Academy. It is this lack of representation that courses like NAL hope to rectify, however problematic they may be. </p>
        <p>Although representation at the university level is imperative, NAL lack of representation extend beyond the university level. In one study conducted by Kenan Metzger and others[9] acknowledged the lack of NAL in high schools and sought to rectify that. The reasoning being that “according to the most recent census[10] there are five million Native Americans in the United States. Of these there are at least 500,000 Native Americans attending public schools.” And yet, there is not curriculum which includes contemporary literature or acknowledges contemporary cultural heritages. Metzger claims “…students not only need to see their cultural heritage acknowledged but can also benefit from having their culture included as part of the learning process.” (Metzger et al, 57). It soon became clear that Native American students were receiving the short end of the stick because any Native American cultures they were learning about came from their history classes where the students stated had too much emphasis over the plain tribes and battles, which, as Metzger states, defined “a whole people through a violent event.” (Metzger et al, 59). It was also observed that, “Non-Native students knew little to nothing about the topics,” further exemplifying the notion from Zitzer-Comfort that students were entering college with little knowledge and preparedness over Native American culture (Metzger et al, 59). This is also concerning as it adds to the lack of community schools have within student populations and how alienated Native students are even today. Not only are students not receiving representation in school curriculum, their peer groups are not receiving cultural awareness and understanding of their classmates.</p>
        <h1 id="Recovery">Recovery Work</h1>
           <p>While there have been several elements of NAL courses that are problematic, several Native American educators have done their best to rectify the issues in NAL courses. In primary and secondary education, instructors have incorporated more opportunities for Native community involvement and representation. Seeing that students were unable to relate to the school’s current curriculum, Metzger and others sought to create a new curriculum for students to see themselves in the literature they were reading, as well as become more involved in school by using the community as inspiration. Teachers from the school worked with various education, English, and Native American groups in the Mesa, Arizona area to develop their curriculum[11]. Together they met and consulted with others to create a Native American Literature course for high school students which met the curriculum requirements set by the state and administration. A pilot study was conducted and in 2010 they began implementation. (Metzger et al, 58). The school did multiple projects focused on Arizonan tribes and reading Native American literature. As a result, Non-Native students learned more about their peers and the communities surrounding the school. Metzger writes, “…students saw how studying multicultural literature helped them to understand their own and others’ cultures, which in turn increased not only tolerance but also understanding in important social contexts in school and in their lives after school.” (Metzger et al, 57).  Native students became more involved in classes as they were excited to discuss and learn about their tribes’ history and culture, “most Native American students chose their own tribe to research, and they presented their information with such pride and detail that they often went over their time limit….” (Metzger et al, 60). The new curriculum succeeded in bringing the students closer to their community and to each other. Not only that, but the results of the study predict more tolerant students and more knowledgeable students moving forward.</p>
           <p>Metzger’s article is not the only published study focusing on recovery work for Native American studies in schools. A similar study was done with 6 elementary school teachers who taught on a reservation. The study was to develop a curriculum “to support the cultural and linguistic needs of their school’s 88% Native American student population.” (Vaughn, 24). This study, documented by Margaret Vaughn, focused on the students’ needs to see representation at their school, to be involved in the schools’ culture, and for resources necessary for teachers to accomplish this goal.</p>
           <p>Another study documented by Kelly Hrenko looked at the recovery work being done by two junior high school teachers in Maine. In this study, the teachers put together an integrated curriculum, merging “visual art, Wabanaki culture, and writing.” In a way to use writing and visual art to “facilitate the exploration of art through the lens of cultural beliefs, family structure, heritage, tradition, social values, and norms of students and teachers.” (Hrenko, 10). The purpose was to reach out to both Native students and at-risk students, two categories that often overlap. Often creative outlets give students more opportunities to comprehend the material and succeed academically by learning with other forms of literacy. The school in Maine is surrounded by Northeastern Native American tribes and artistic communities, which made this curriculum relevant to the school and easy to access for community involvement. Hrenko comments of this when she states, “…pedagogy that validates and embraces students’ cultures by bringing it into the classroom seems particularly appropriate and necessary.” (Hrenko, 13). A great outcome of the new curriculum was the focus on multiple modes and literacies for the students to work with. Students used creative writing and visual art concurrently while learning about the Native tribes. In doing so they were able to explore new avenues of learning. With written, oral, and visual literacies present, students were exposed to new forms of art and discussion. Students were able to use creative writing in this case to “bring everyone to the conversation, validating all experiences, and dialoguing about our various positions in this complex society.” (Hrenko, 16). This sentiment is shared with multiple writers across the globe, but especially those who have be silenced by the dominate cultural group. In this case, students were able to see the influence and rewards creative outlets bring as they created stories and pieces of art to showcase[12]. The experience, Hrenko says, improved the students’ critical abilities and understanding of their community.</p>
           <p>In the previous section, I discussed several criticisms to NAL courses at the university level. However, those criticisms were not without recovery advice. One program for Native American representation recovery is an MFA program implemented in 2013 at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Led by a staff of approximately 16 published writers (75% NA), one of whom is Sherman Alexie. The program has had success. In the article, “one student quoted that she wanted to ‘see more stories written by Native American who have broad worldviews and non-traditional experiences.’ Stating, “…we’re still stuck in the Billy Jack era as far as [Native] literature goes.’…stressing that the genre needs to move beyond the 1970s action-drama depicting Native American life.” (Jung, 37). The MFA program hopes to change the stereotype of Native American literature with the creation of more Native American creative writers.[13]</p>
           <p>Several educators who wrote about the issues surrounding NAL courses also had a lot to say on how to improve these courses so they exemplify appropriate Native American literature and cultural traditions[14]. Joseph Bruchac, who wrote over his experiences teaching NAL at the college level recommended four simple directions for those teaching NAL courses. His first recommendation is to clearly define what ‘Native American Literature’ means to you and for the purpose of the class you teach. Bruchac states, “…Remember that we are referring, in fact, to many nations…to many literatures, literature which each come from a national identity and a strong sense of place.” (Bruchac, 5). Likewise, Patrice Hollrah, who argued over Sherman Alexie’s objections to most NAL reading lists through his novel, reflected that the solution is simply to choose authentic texts that are written by authentic Native Americans. For NAL courses to teach Native American literature that is deemed ‘authentic’ by and from Native Americans, instructors and curriculum should specific what type of Native American literature will be represented in the class.</p>
           <p>Bruchac’s second recommendation is to teach the literature in context. He writes, …if you are teaching Native American literature well you are not just teaching literature, you are also teaching culture. To understand the work – or to begin to understand it – it must be seen as it was used. The word is regarded as alive…” (Bruchac, 6). Many other educators agree with Bruchac on this point as almost all other recover suggestions focus on contextualizing the literature for student understanding. Annette Portillo uses Native American literature, personal testimonies, and community involvement to teach her course[15]. For her, NAL should focus on understanding Native American values through their literature. She teaches this understanding by focusing on finding themes within the literature based on the literature’s context and history. She writes, </p>
           <p>In addition to assigning articles that broaden the student’s understanding of the unique experiences of Native Americans in relationship to the history of colonialism, genocide, and patriarchy, I also emphasize how these primary and secondary sources are in every way connected to living communities. It would be a disservice to students if these works were taught in isolation to their socio-historical contexts and disconnected from native voices. This pedagogical approach to teaching is crucial to not only building bridges within the classroom between students, but also building bridges within indigenous communities and the academy. (Portillo, 169).</p>
           <p>Portillo believes that not only should Native American literature be taught in historical context, but also in communal context. She discusses in her work how she uses guest speakers to involve the Native community in her class. This serves multiple purposes as it helps bridge the gap between the academy and the Native community, promotes student involvement in and out of the classroom, and it incorporates personal testimonies which Portillo believes is “pertinent to underscore the oral tradition as a legitimate way in which to ‘record history.’” (Portillo, 166). Portillo’s inclusion of personal testimonies became a way in which Portillo validated other forms of literacy of the Native community within the academy. </p>
           <p>Carol Zitzer-Comfort takes Bruchac’s two recommendations and uses them to complement each other. She contends that for students to understand what they read teachers need to “define what kind of understanding [they] are hoping students will attain as they read.” Afterall, “While good books can and do transcend cultural boundaries, students gain a world of knowledge by reading American Indian literature in historical, sociocultural, and political context.” This is a big point for Zitzer-Comfort. She makes the analogy of reading American Indian literature without context is like reading African American literature without knowledge of slavery. “What power would Beloved lose if read by someone who had no awareness of the horrors of slavery?” (Zitzer-Comfort, 168).</p>
           <p>Bruchac’s third and fourth recommendations are similar in the sense that they both deal with communication with contemporary Native tribes. Like Portillo’s statement that literature is connected to “living communities,” Bruchac advices that instructors pay close attention to continuance in Native literature and be wary of translations. Continuance is described by Bruchac as the concept of ‘time’ within Native American literature. He explains that often native languages understand time differently than English and therefore translations can be tricky if not done properly. Hollrah also points this out in her article; understanding of Native American literature as appropriately authentic can only come if communication with Native Americans happens. Hollrah urges readers to avoid literature co-written by white authors, Portillo brings in guest speakers, Bruchac stresses continuance by “constantly linking contemporary Native writers to their roots, to their people and their places, their traditions.” (Bruchac, 6). For the purpose of translations, Bruchac states that “A good teacher of Native American literature needs to know enough to be able to know which works need to be shown special respect.” In other words, the translations which have been translated authentically, which respect to the original language and intent. He goes on to write, “it is safest to use work which has been translated by Native scholars themselves…show respect. Walk slowly. Listen to Native people.” (Bruchac, 7). This is the argument that Hollrah eventually ends on: literature taught in NAL courses should be written by Native Americans, translated to English by Native Americans, and taught by Native Americans. While Bruchac is more lenient, he nevertheless agrees that Native American literature must be Native American translated. While there has been many articles covering NAL course suggestions and recovery options, most of these articles are fairly recent. NAL recovery work is still being studied and created for the benefit of Native American representation in and out of schools.</p>
        <h1 id="Con">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>As Native American representation grows in other areas of American society[16],  Native American representation in literature has been overlooked by the academy. The introduction of and popularity of Native American Literature gave power, authority, and voice to indigenous groups into an area where they were voiceless.</p>

    <p>Note that my footnotes are not linked yet.</p>
    <p>[1] This is a term used to describe how the dominant cultural group (in America this would be Caucasian peoples) view nondominant groups. This term was originally coined in reference to African American literature in which the ‘white gaze’ affected the imagination and writing styles of Black authors due to the assumption that the reader would be ‘white.’ The term is used frequently among Black authors, particularly Toni Morrison, and has caused many Black authors to consider how they write creative fiction and for whom they write creative fiction. This term applies to any dominant cultural group and subsequent non-dominant cultural groups. [Link to Toni Morrison’s video]. </p>
    <p>[2] In the time period necessary for completing this web-text, and amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, I was unable to get a hold of David Wallace Adams’ book, Education for Extinction. However, it was one that was consistently mentioned in many articles pertaining to Native American boarding schools. Other books mentioned include studies written by K. Tsianina Lomawaima, Brenda Child, and Sally Hyer.</p>
    <p>[3] When writing a large paper, I will often go through each article I am quoting and pre-type all of the quotes I plan to use or ones that I felt really jumped out at me. I will also pre-type paraphrases of sections I don’t want to quote, but I might want to use later in my paper. In doing this, I add the in-text citation to the end of the quotes and I include names in all the in-text citations so I can identify where they came from easily. Therefore, my quotes will have the same in-text citation format instead of typical MLA citation format (posting the name first and leaving it off the concurrent citations) because I haven’t yet gone through and changed them.</p>
    <p>[4] This comment is taken from the quote “…American Indian students account for less than 1 percent of the population on most university campuses…” (Zitzer-Comfort, 161). </p>
    <p>[5] To my recollection I have read at least two pieces written by Native American creative writers. This number may be more, but I can only remember two specific pieces. One story, written by Sherman Alexie, was in a course called ‘The American Short Story.’ This course was dedicated to all short stories that make up the American culture and included works by a variety authors from around the country dating from the 1800’s to the present. The other Native American work I remember reading was a poem by Leslie Marmon Silko but I cannot remember the course I read it in.  </p>
    <p>[6] Omitted authors from this quotation include Ralph Ellison, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Richard Wright, Frederick Douglass, and Langston Hughes.</p>
    <p>[7] Literature with a capital “L” is often referred to as the ‘Canon.’ The Western Canon is a collection of works that are deemed to appropriate represent a literary period, genre, or to evaluate other literary works against older and more ‘established’ works based on popularity or esteem within the Academy. In American universities, the Western Canon is used to determine what should be taught as ‘necessary’ literature within an English degree track. </p>
    <p>[8] For more information about the national ‘Canon,’ see Arnold Krupat’s “Native American Literature and the Canon” and Susan Hegeman’s “Native American ‘Texts’ and the Problem of Authenticity.”</p>
    <p>[9] Study was conducted and written by Kenan Metzger, Andrea Box, and James Blasingame. </p>
    <p>[10] This article was published in 2013. Therefore, the ‘most recent census’ could have been the 2012 or 2013 census. </p>
    <p>[11] The consortium meetings started in 2007 in the Mesa, Arizona area. </p>
    <p>[12] The students’ visual art was shown in a Portland public art exhibit, which increased validation in student work and indigenous literacies. Unfortunately, the name of the show and any specific names have been excluded from the article so I was unable to find pictures or a website of the exhibit. </p>
    <p>[13] Bring in 1970’s stuff from previous section?</p>
    <p>[14] I would like to include Estrada’s article over using online hubs for Native Americans in class to emphasize free voices and Native American online communities, but it doesn’t seem to fit. Estrada’s article goes into detail describing the various online presence available for Native American groups, literatures, and cultural representations. </p>
    <p>[15] I recommend reading Portillo’s and Zitzer-Comfort’s articles for specific reading materials and teaching pedagogies. </p>
    <p>[16] This is an entirely different paper.</p>
