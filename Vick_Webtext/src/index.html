      <h1>Introduction</h1><br>
      <p>As an educator I see a need for students to have an outlet to voice the events of the world that surrounds them. As an educator in the urban core, it is more important than ever that students to be both aware of the power of social justice as well as knowledgeable about the power that they have to change the future. Many of my students feel voiceless and sometimes believe that they will never leave the neighborhood in which they live; some even believe that they will not live passed their 20th birthday. By giving students a voice and platform, they can see that their lives do matter and that they have something to offer to the world. Teaching social justice through poetry to urban youth offers both a creative and rhetorical outlet that facilitates pride, hope, and change for their communities.</p><br>
      <h1>Analysis</h1><br>
      <p>It has been known for years the power that poetry and song has had in delivering powerful rhetorical arguments for change. Educators also understand that part of teaching students the art of reading and writing is to guide them along the path of being civically minded and that, when they enter fully into the adult world, must stay well informed and be aware of the power each of them has to make changes in the world. Starting with past poets is essential to build the background and understanding students will need to understand that they too can speak on social justice and make a change. Listening to voices of the past, develop voices for the future. Not a day goes by that we do not hear about racially tied events on the news. From the shootings in churches to questioning people’s reasons to be in a specific location now make the front page of newspapers, main headlines of news stations, and viral sensations via social media. Unlike the past, racially motivated events are now front centered. What could make this more apparent is hearing voices through creative outlets of experiences they have had involving some of the same racially motivated comments and/or events. </p><br>

      <p> A. Vincent Ciardiello calls this out immediate in his article when he states, “Reading and writing age-appropriate social justice poetry can provide students with a compelling voice that starts them on the path to democratic citizenship” (Ciardiello 464). When students are allowed to see through the eyes of a poet, they are introduced to a world where figurative language allows for unmatched creativity and a unique way to create a rhetorical argument. Children already have a rudimentary understanding of the social justice concept and are quite aware that in the world around them, sometimes things just don’t seem fair. Further, using the analysis of social justice poetry as well as incorporating the multigenre format, students are able to fully grasp the intricacies of the poetic expression for social justice. Ciardiello also noted that “[l]iteracy can play a role as a resource for cultivating civic responsibility and social justice in childhood education” (Ciardiello 464). By exposing students to examples of social justice, in our case through poetry, students are guided to seeing the world on how it should be and through writing social justice poetry be given the opportunity in making their voices known. </P><br>
      <p>In Rhythm and Resistance: Teaching Poetry for Social Justice, the author reveals that “in fact the act of standing up and talking back empowers students, gives hope. It’s inaction that leads to despair” (Christensen and Watson 149). Teachers often do not like to have students talk back to them, but you can direct that desire and have them stand up for something they believe in through writing poetry. In a unit of study such as this I have the students create a book of their own poetry surrounding a specific theme for the unit. This particular unit will focus on social justice, giving a voice to my students who sometimes feel voiceless. For each of the poems analyze below, students will write social justice poetry utilizing the literary techniques that these particular poems utilized to create meaning for the reader. The literary techniques vary from poet to poet in this unit, but the common literary techniques that keep surfacing through this study are imager, similes, allusions, and metaphors. In this book of poetry, they should include written works that discuss social inequalities and inequities that they witness in their lives. More examples of the types of poetry students can write in the proceeding paragraphs. Note that these are just suggestions. The whole goal of a unit is to give students who previously felt voiceless a voice. This voice not only leads to standing their ground in a world that ruled by colors, but also learning that they have a voice that can be used to issue change in this unfair world.</P><br>
      <p>Before students can write their own poetry focusing on social justice, it is always best practice to study those who came before. Many students may have already either read these poems or know of the authors that will be mentioned. This will help them understand more of the message the authors were attempted to provide their readers as well as the stirrings of issuing social change for the future. The first poem that would be an excellent example of social justice poetry of the past is “We Wear the Mask” by Paul Laurence Dunbar. This is one of his most know poems that is used in ELA classrooms across America. This particular poem has been in almost every anthology I have taught in my 15 years in education. Not only is this poem so well known, it also carries with it an excellent addition to a social justice poetry unit. Typically, this poem is used to teach imagery and is an excellent example of how imagery in a poem can carry a significant meaning. Including this poem in a social justice unit allows for the teacher to simultaneously teach one of the most important literary devices, but also opens the door for a discussion on racism and stereotypes as well as noting the rhetorical message that Dunbar included in this masterpiece. The title itself, “We Wear the Mask,” denotes a dual meaning and this is the best place to start when leading students through an analysis of any poem. The title reveals quite a bit about the misplaced emotions and ideals that mainstream American had in regards to African Americans. First, it could simply be the speaker revealing that people do not truly see him or any African American for who they truly are and what they could contribute to the world. In a way, he is saying that they are hiding behind the stereotypes created by the white man. Another way to read this title is to note the significance of when this particular poem was written. Dunbar published the poem in 1896, during a time where the minstrel shows were still very popular. In these racist and demeaning performances both white men and white women would paint their faces black and then, using extremely racist stereotypes, perform African American songs and dances in very flamboyant ways. This perpetuated the stereotypes of all Black people and the plight they experienced during slavery and beyond. From the title and a cursory read of the text, students will note the anger that simmers in this poem. He begins the text use the following visual image and reveals, “We wear the mask that grins and lies / It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes” (Dunbar 1-2). Here he is referring to the pain and emotions that all African Americans are facing throughout the country at the time and sadly, still face today. What students will pick up on is that he is saying that they must pretend to be happy and cheery in a country that so despises them. He is referring to the fact that the world just does not want to see the pain and suffering of people that have been persecuted and they must carry on and pretend they are happy. </p><br>
      <p>Another unique aspect of this particular poem is the use of rhetorical devices which are often not thought of when reading and analyzing poetry, but if you follow the school of thought that everything is an argument, then yes, rhetorical devices do occur even in prose and poetry. This especially true of social justice poetry and is important for students to have this understand that an argument can be anything whether it be a tweet, music video, poem, television or newspaper ad, or even an image. Poetry does not only try to express emotions, but is also asserting a rhetorical argument. In “We Wear the Mask,” Dunbar poses a rhetorical question to the reader which asks “Why should the world be over-wise, / In counting all our tears and sighs?” (Dunbar 6-7). Through his question, he is revealing that he believes that the world does not care about him or other African American so what would the use of them seeing it. He is commenting on the fact that White American did not concern themselves with the plight of African Americans and was contemplating the need for them to see their sorrow. He is demonstrating that even if they were aware of their pain, White America will still not change. To facilitate a classroom discussion for Dunbar’s poem, the teacher may ask: Does this belief Dunbar relates in his poem still pertain to our generation today? Students may reply yes, stating that whenever someone of color brings up race and injustice, their cries of frustration are either ignored or ridiculed. Or other students may bring up Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement when emotions were definitely running high and African Americans did not attempt to hide their angry, frustration, or sadness. It was put on for the world to see thanks to both print and televised news medias. The discussion of social justice through this poem will bring about deep and thoughtful discussion in any classroom. “Talking Walls” discusses how important it is for students to study and discuss texts based on social justice and states, “Students need to develop and express civic responsibility through classroom interactions and subject matter learning” (Ciardiello 464). The author is arguing that when teaching social justice it needs to occur both by discussion around the topic and how it relates to their lives. Many students have witnessed social injustice have stories of their own to tell. Guiding them along the path to understanding how important their stories are, help to them into civically minded teenagers. As students meander their way through this unit, they will be called on between poem studies to craft a poem calling for social justice. In relation to Dunbar’s poem, they may chose to write a poem relating a time where they may had to hide who they were because they felt required to act a certain way to different people or may write about a time when they were approach and judged based upon stereotypes. It gives students power to put words to events in their lives that they felt may have been over looked.</p><br>
      <p>It may be worth discussing with students how Paul Laurence Dunbar’s poem is angry and evasive, and then introduce Langston Hughes’ works which tend to be semi hopeful for the future of African Americans in American. Like Dunbar, Langston Hughes is another popular author that teachers refer to when either teaching the Harlem Renaissance or simply literary devices. It should be noted, that “[p]oetry of social justice is not politically neutral. It is biased toward democracy. For the oppressed and marginalized, this poetry represents power as the voice of the dispossessed” (Ciardiello 466). This very idea is demonstrated by Langston Hughes in both examples of his poetry. Sometimes the social justice aspect of his poetry is forgotten, but can be reinvigorated as a pathway to help students find their own voices. One such poem that demonstrates the power of voice and dreams is “Daybreak in Alabama.” This particular poem is an excellent example of a hopeful and powerful method to expressing Hughes’ future outlook for social justice. Again, instructing students to analyze the title helps to reveal the message that Langston Hughes wants his readers to gain from his poem. By the historical and social aspects of the country during that time that Langston Hughes wrote his poetry, one may conclude that “Daybreak in Alabama” may signify a time where social and racial strife is no longer the reputation of this particular Southern state. Daybreak could easily refer to a new dawn of peace and unity within the world amongst races. The speaker begins by stating “When I get to be a colored composer / I’m gonna write me some music about / Daybreak in Alabama” (Hughes 1-3). The most powerful statement that emerges at the very beginning of the poem. The speaker does not use “if” he becomes a composer, it is “when.” Which demonstrates Hughes’ positivity in what the future holds for his people. Also, the term “colored composer” just like the title has a secondary meaning. Not only will be a Black composer, he will also paint Alabama as a state with harmony between all races. Also, by choosing one of the most racist states in the Union as the state the speaker wishes to compose in, in was his way of demonstrating that if Alabama is unified and racism is no longer an issue, then the rest of the country would have already done this as well. In a way, he is making the argument that once all races unify, its melodious composition of peace and tranquility will paint the landscape like a beautiful painting. This theme continues throughout the rest of the poem by celebrating the beauty of all the colors that make up Alabama. From this understanding of beauty, kindness follows. This particular poem would make for an interesting conversation in the classroom. Students may argue that Langston Hughes’ vision is still struggling in the United States today. On a daily basis the news shares incidents where people are still judged based up on their color. By continue the poem’s conversation 100 years in the future, educators are leading their students to pick up his mantle to continue pushing for this idealistic society for the future generations. </p><br>
      <p>Another famous poem written by Langston Hughes was written in response to a poem written previously by Walt Whitman. “I Hear America Singing” which addresses the various professions that help to make America the country she is. In his poem, Whitman shares his belief that the working class is what makes American the strong country as he sees it. This poem has some very lofty ideals and, by itself, provides a strong message to the audience. However, this poem was written prior to the end of the Civil War and slavery was still in full force. This calls into questions the first line of his poem that reads, “I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear” (Whitman 1). In this line of poetry, Whitman is referring to the sounds of the working class, but never once mentions the slaves and their “songs” who more than anyone elevated America to the status of greatness of his time. When addressing this with students, a teacher can assign students to research the timeframe in which Whitman’s poem was written. As result of this research, students will lead to an inquiry level discussion about both Whitman’s poem, but possibly the reasoning behind him not including the slaves in his poem. Was it out of shame? Did he editors have him remove it? Did he just not think of the slaves when he wrote his piece? With contrasting Whitman’s poem with Langston Hughes’ poem “I, Too” students are being introduced to social justice message in “I, Too.” As the students analyze this poem, they begin to formulate what Hughes’ message was to his audience and, to some regard, to Walt Whitman himself. Through “I, Too,” the speaker is providing his argument of why he, too sings America. When Hughes states, “I, too, sing America” he is responding directly to all of America, but primarily addressing Whitman’s poem. The speaker is telling the audience he is just as much a part of America as all the other white laborers. This a power example of speaking up for oneself in the face of adversity. The poem continues with the speaker stating “I am the darker brother. / They sent me to eat in the kitchen” which highlights the practice of segregation within the United States and responds to the social commentary of time (Hughes, “I, Too” 2-3). Hughes follows this social commentary up with “But I laugh, / And eat well, / And grow strong” (Hughes, “I, Too” 5-7). Through this commentary the speaker reveals that he is biding his time until the world accepts him by still enjoying life, as segregated as it is, learning all he can to be ready to make changes in America for all African Americans. Students will also note through their close reading, that just like the previous poem, Hughes has a positive outlook for the future and feels confident that things will one day change. The speaker expresses this through the following stanza: “Tomorrow, / I’ll be at the table / When company comes.” (Hughes, “I, Too” 8-10). Through the speaker, the reader will note that this specific part of stanza two is referring to the future and that in the future all will be welcomed and allowed to have credit where credit is due. Lines 11-14 reveal another layer of social justice that Langston Hughes dreamt about. These lines state, “Nobody’ll dare /. Say to me, / ‘Eat in the kitchen,’ / Then” and reveal Hughes beliefs about social justice in the future (Hughes, “I, Too” 11-14). In his belief the future will not look kindly at discrimination and dare to tell someone where they belong and don’t belong. Langston Hughes’ “I,Too” does exactly what social justice poetry is intended to do and that is to humanize both the poet, but also the people being refered to in the poem. Ciardiello points out through Pinksy’s research that demonstrates this very idea and states “Some contemporary poets believe that the primary purpose of social justice poetry is to humanize” (466). This is the very definition of poetry. It seeks to humanize. When students are made aware of the real purpose of poetry, which is to express emotions, they become cognizant of just how powerful their voices become. By aiming those voices in poetry, the world can hear them more clearly just like Langston Hughes and Paul Laurence Dunbar. The world knows these two names and their messages will continue for future generations. </p><br>
      <p>By focusing students on the lens of social justice while reading poetry will reveal to them the dreams of poets’ past not just for themselves, but for all. According to Ciardiello, “Poetry of social justice is empathic by nature. It emphasizes with the feelings of others, especially minorities (466). When the reader can empathetically relate to the subject of the poem, more of a connection is made and, as a result, sympathy for the previously unknown circumstance is created. When sympathy exist, more change can occur and this most definitely can happen through poetry which Langston Hughes demonstrates near the end of his poem. The last part of stanza two of “I, Too” reveals a future when it is unacceptable to tell someone that they do not belong alongside someone else just for a perceived difference either in skin color, gender, or ethnicity. However, the students are well aware of the various acts of racism that have gone viral on social media platforms which demonstrates that even today there are places that others believe that people of color should not inhabit. One such example, is the gentleman who was trying to enter his apartment building and a white woman refused to let him through because she couldn’t verify if he did indeed live in the apartment building. Even after he stated to her that he did indeed lived in the building as well as stating that she was not the landlord who he mentioned by name. Even with this information she proceeded to follow him throughout the building until he made his way to his apartment. At one point, she even demanded for him to tell her who he was visiting as if he couldn’t afford to live there. Eventually, he made it to his apartment door and put his key in, and it really wasn’t until that moment that she seemed appeased. Students will note as they research deeper into this case that this woman did lose her job over this event. They see that there were consequences for her actions, but a conversation about this is still very much necessary in America today. The ultimate goal of this unit is to not only introduce students to the need to read and analyze social justice poetry of the past, but to lead them onward to writing social justice poetry of their own based upon their own experiences of the world.

      <p>Another author who is used quite frequently in English Language Arts classrooms is Maya Angelou. Her poetry hints to issues of racism, sexism, and intersectionality. One of her most noted poems, “Caged Bird” reveals a divided world. One part of the population is free to roam the world, explore, and reach success; whereas, another demographic must be content with never have true freedom to grow and explore. Maya Angelou begins her poem, “Caged Bird,” simply enough with a beautiful scene of a bird flying over the ground in all its splendor. However, the message she is sending out through even the first stanza of the poem is that when a person has the freedom to move around the world without stereotypes and limitations, then anything is possible. This is exactly what parents and educators want for their children. To live in a world without limitations and where stereotypes do not determine who we are and what we do without lives. Those who are free can reach for the stars, but those who are held back and limited on what they are allowed to do in the world are wrapped in the form of a caged bird. Students may wish discuss this from this vantage point, where they may feel that their parents and schools do not give them the freedom that they desire. They may also discuss how this type of duality plays out in their own lives and how they compare their world with that of peers in more affluent schools. </p><br>
      <p>The first stanza of Angelou’s poem is positive and paints a beautiful picture if freedom; however, the second stanza illuminates the world that African Americans have been experience for hundreds of years. This second stanza begins with the following lines, “But a bird that stalks / down his narrow cages / can seldom see through / his bars of rage” (Angelou 8-11). These lines are demonstrating a speaker who is so full of rage at seeing how others are allowed to live their lives with no regard to race as being a factor. For this speaker, this is the discrepancy she has been witnessing her entire life. One person is allowed to walk in the world without a care and can reach any heights that they put their minds to. Her on the other, is stuck in a world that is telling her that she cannot reach for that because of the stereotypes placed upon her by others. She is confined to one type of life and is not allowed to take risks like someone else of another race. Many of the students in the urban core can relate to the speaker in Maya Angelou’s poem. They see this daily on television and when they go to work. Through the power of discussion, students can express the thoughts, experiences, and maybe even some hope about how the world has changed since this poem was written and where it can go from here. They witness how some individuals experience the world in different and much freer ways, and also see the struggle they or many of their family members go through just to make their way in the world. Some of this is due to socioeconomic levels, but much of it is tied to race. Just like the speaker in “Caged Bird,” they yearn to be able to experience the world freely without any hindrances holding them back. By discussing the themes found in this poem along what they have learned about literary devices, students will then be required to write a poem that not only practices the literary devices taught, but they will also have to opportunity to write about a time where they felt that others were treated different based upon their race and/or socioeconomic standing. This provides them with the opportunity to practice what they have learned as well as make known to the world how unfair it can be for them. Through their own writing they will be able to give a voice to the pain, sorrow, and frustration they feel about things in their own lives. This provides an outlet to let the world know that they still witness the hypocrisy of it and is calling it out. Within their, they will find power. Just as the powerful statement that Angelou ends her poem with. She states,</p>
      <p>
        <center>“The caged bird sings
      </p>
      <p> With a fearful trill</p>
      <p> Of things unknown </p>
      <p> But longed for still </p>
      <p> And his tune is heard</p>
      <p> On the distant hill </p>
      <p>For the caged bird </p>
      <p> Sings of freedom”</p>
      <p> (Angelou 31-38). </center>
      </p>
      <p>Even in her own poem, she acknowledges the power of the written word and how, even like a bird singing in a cage, if one sings loud enough and long enough the song will be heard and then change can begin. She is totally correct when she pursues the idea that because the call is one of freedom, it cannot be ignored. Through the speaker the students learn that persistence pays off and that the struggle must continue until everyone is truly free and can live their lives like a bird flying through the sky. Maya Angelou’s “Caged Bird” also opens up a variety of talking points for students to participate through class discussions and, because we live in the digital age, many other examples of unfair treatment due to race can be brought into the classroom.</p><br>
      <p>Another one of Maya Angelou’s poems that I like to introduce to my class is “Still I Rise.” This poem not only addresses racial driven belief, but also the pride that Black women have about themselves. (Use the video of the woman writing a check and being denied: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9QBnPK6Yg) In this video, she discussed the idea of the “angry black woman” and had to run through all the scenarios in her head before she could respond. Her statements call into question not only racism that Black people face, but added to that, women also have to deal with sexism added on to the already present racism. It is a well-documented fact that African Americans have been experiencing racism and bigotry for hundreds of years. In Maya Angelou’s poem, “Still I Rise” she not only responds to racism, but responds to the deeper bigoty found laid bare against Black women. Students are very aware the of the duality of racism directed at African American woman and empathize with their plight. To preface this poem, students must be aware of the basics of intersectionality. Intersectionality is a concept that was developed by Kimberle Crenshaw who explains the basics of intersectionality through the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViDtnfQ9FHc. In the video she explains that intersectionality is a term applied to the multifaceted layers of discrimination. Crenshaw goes on to say that this layered form of racism takes place still in today’s society when it comes to the treatment of young Black women in school and reveals that these young ladies are more likely than their white counterparts to getting harsher penalties and treatment. By showing this video during class and discussing the students’ viewpoints on the topic will help to generate a deeper understanding of the poem and the additional types of poetry that they can include in their publication. This will provide students for a time to reflect where they have seen this type of racial disparities occurring within their own lives. As students read through “Still I Rise,” the lens should be altered somewhat and instructions should be given so that the students not only read to discover discussions of racism, but also that of sexism and classism. Both terms should be covered prior to students reading the text. </p><br>
      <p>Like many of the other poems included in this type of unit, imagery and metaphor play large parts, but in the case of “Still I Rise,” Angelou also includes allusions to mythological figures as well. Again, for students to be able to adequately analyze this poem, they must also be aware of the various allusions that she uses within her text. She begins her poem with the following lines: “You may write me down in history / With your bitter, twisted lies” (Angelou, “Still I Rise” 1-2). Her speaker calls out the historical stereotypes that have been directed toward African American women for generations. She doesn’t go into detail, but the reference is there nonetheless. In the “The Literate and the Literary” by Elizabeth McHenry and Shirley Brice Heath demonstrates that women have been judged unfairly and differently for quite a bit. In fact, stirrings of these sentimentalities about Black women are still omnipresent today. The text which was highlighting the literary contributions that African American states, “their club activities were their uses of writing in order to spread news of their causes, to stir up financial and political support within their regions, and to organizer protest writings to counter presentations in the White press of the immorality of Black women” (Mchenry and Heath 428). This statement reveals that the press, like today, attempted to perpetuate the narrative that African American women are somehow devoid of standard social morals which were blatantly false. African American women have been attempting to change this perception for a long time, but, unfortunately, they still persist in our society today. African American women are quite frequently stereotyped as having low socioeconomics circumstances with multiple children with no father present. The idea that African American women are somehow more immoral than other women still exists today. Maya Angelou’s poem is, in a way, an open letter to other African American women to not let these false narratives define who they know that they are even though the speaker is addressing a hateful audience. Making students aware that there are nuances to racism helps them in finding their voice for what may have been a forgotten angle of racial inequalities toward the African American people. </p><br>
      <p>Students are very familiar with one of the literary devices that she weaved throughout her poetry. Many students are able to identify and explain the deeper meaning the author is really attempting to relate to her reader. From there they understand the concepts that Anglou has laced throughout her poem and how it relates to the world around them. She uses similes to compare her behavior and demeanor to those who have easy access to wealth. One of the most memorable similes students zoom in on is “Does my haughtiness offend you? / Don’t you take it awful hard/ ‘Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines / Diggin’ in my own backyard” (Angelou, “Still I Rise” 17-20). The rhetorical question in the first line address the idea of racist White individuals that people of color, specifically an African American, have a specific place in life and when they hold themselves up to a high standard of behavior and decorum White people are somehow offended. In this question, she is calling out this outdated belief. Instead of acting the way racist American think she should act, she acts as if she is equal to her audience if not better than them. In reality, she is. She is holding herself to a high standard that is often not believed about African American women. Again, the intersectionality of bigotry is highlighted very well here. The speaker is demonstrating that even if you do not have much money, you can still act as if you do. Nothing is standing is someone’s way of acting better than the stereotype says they have to. This particular concept is not hard for students to grasp. They have seen examples of this very stereotype played out in their own lives as well as on television and in the news media. Some of them have even seen family members discriminated in this way. The powerful messages students receive from Angelou’s poem will contribute to their understanding that the social justice can take place through the poetry genre and will inspire them to make their messages heard. </p><br>
      <p>Angelou continues the positivity and perseverance of Black women throughout her poem leading up to the final two stanzas. These last two stanzas reveal more about the speaker’s pride in her people. They state:</p>
      <p>
        <center>Out of the huts of history’s shame
          <p>I rise</p>
          <p>Up from a past that’s rooted in pain</p>
          <p> I rise</p>
          <p>I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,</p>
          <p>Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.</p><br>

          <p> Leaving behind nights of terror and fear</p>
          <p> I rise</p>
          <p>Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear</p>
          <p>I rise</p>
          <p>Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,</p>
          <p> I am the dream and the hope of the slave.</p>
          <p> I rise</p>
          <p>(Angelou “Still I Rise” 29-41).
        </center>

      <p>Through these two statements she is revealing to her audience that she comes from a rich history of strong and enduring people for which they should be proud. These strengths of character have led her speaker to the final understanding that, slowly, the past of hate and fear are subsiding and she is humble and proud to come from such a strong cultural background. “Still I Rise” addresses both the doubters and other African American women. Not only does her poem call out social injustice, she also gives hope and pride to the Black women who read her poem. By instilling pride in others, the social justice she discusses throughout her poem inspire other women to be proud of where they came from and act as though they are equal or better than those who seek to oppress them. “Still I Rise” is the perfect example of a poem “that captures a crystallized moment or a strong emotion [that] can prompt a dialogue about both the issue described and the response to that issue” (Vardell 16). This emotionally charged poem will facilitate conversation of the meanings and nuances that she reveals in her poetry. Teenagers are driven to talk and “Still I Rise” gives them that opportunity to make their opinions and experiences heard. </p><br>
      <p>Social justice does not only fall into the realm of just poetry, but can also be seen in the other sphere of poetry, music. One such musician or rap artist that students often gravitate to is Tupac. Students are very familiar with him and some are aware that he also has a published book of poetry titled The Rose that Grew from Concrete. There are several poems in his anthology that can be considered as social justice poetry, bhe namesake poem that the book was titled after offers a stark image of life for children in the city. Children has several needs that they require to thrive and when socioeconomics and racism applies, several of those needs may be missing. Tupac himself titled this poem as “autobiographical.” This description helps the audience, primarily my students, to realize that this poem is about himself and his thoughts and feelings on how he views himself. He begins his poem with a rhetorical question: “Did u hear about the rose that grew from a crack / in the concrete” (Shakur 1-2). He describes himself as a rose. The word itself has plenty of different meanings. This opening question demonstrates a lot about how he seems himself. By opening up a discussion in the classroom and asking students to define a rose, a plethora of descriptions will be provided. Students may note that a rose has thorns so if you are not careful, you can get hurt. They may also say how a rose is considered one of the most beautiful and elegant of flowers and is the prize any woman wants for Valentine’s Day. They may also bring up that a rose is soft and delicate which demonstrates that the author, even though he grew up in the city, he has a giant heart and can easily be hurt. However, students may also note that the thorns any rose act like armor to protect the gentle rose from being damaged and may also equate the speaker as someone who is both beautiful and elegant. The speaker is stating that even in a city filled with concrete, where everything is hard and unforgiving, beauty and elegance can still develop. In many ways, he gives hope to those who find themselves trapped within a situation they do not see a way out of. Throughout the rest of the poem, Tupac demonstrates how he proved “nature’s laws wrong” by surviving and flourishing in an environment so unbelievably hostile (Shakur 3). Students may pick up on how these laws may also be tied to city, state, and federal laws that are sometimes unfairly enforced for one group over another. Throughout his poem, he is offering hope to the reader about growing, thriving, and flourishing even against all odds and through this message is bringing awareness to the unfair treatment and stereotypes of those who live in the inner city tend to receive.</p><br>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1><br>
      <p>Sandra Falkner made the following observation: “The use of poetry as political statement is intended to evoke embodied responses and resonate with readers to have them experience the poetry as evocative mediators of, oftentimes, painful societal events and expectations and limitations, and to recognize and tell their own stories” (Faulkner 2). Teaching students using social justice poetry opens up a conversation path that may have been closed before. Through this study, they learn that argument comes in many forms and that they too can issue social change as well. Poetry is such a powerful medium that is more reachable than most and can have even more of an impact on a person’s life. Urban youth sometimes feels like the world has left them behind and through social justice poetry they can find their voices to lead their community through pride and hope to issue change in the world.</p><br>
