<article class="Introduction">
    <p id="Introduction"></p>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>Here, I will introduce my main topic. I will be examining Afrofuturism, specifically in Marvel's 2018 film, Black Panther. I think this film brings together many important threads about black literacy and agency, while refering to the past, present, and future. Black Panther frames literacy, whether refering to education or technological knowledge, as the true property of black culture despite centuries of white theft and colonizing. In this intro, I will frame and define Afrofuturism and introduce the main themes of the film.</p>

    <p>This will be the rest of the introduction. I will specifically reference the trailer for the film (embeded above). The playlist below will also give context to the ideas of Afrofuturism I will be introducing.</p>  

    <p>If you are interested in how Afrofuturism is expressed through other mediums than film, here is a great source for music. This Spotify playlist, curated by musician Janelle Monae and writer/filmmaker Ytasha Womack, showcases songs directly inspired by Afrofuturism. </p>

<article class="Analysis">
    <p id="Analysis"></p>
    <h1>Analysis</h1>

    <p>This is where I will discuss how literacy, education, and technology are connected to power in Black Panther. I have several sources explaining how power and literacy are expressed within the film. By showing this alternate reality of an Africa untouched by colonization, the film acts as a powerful refutation of many of the arguments for literacy-as-white-property. However, I do also have several sources that attack the film or focus on potential flaws in the movie. This will be an important part of the analysis, offering a chance to form a rebuttal.</p>

    <p>Here, I will focus on analyzing Wakanda specifically, referencing the featurette video embedded above. I will also look at the end of the film, where T'Challa moves to broaden the reach of literacy-as-black-property through his outreach to youth in Oakland. The mid-credits scene of the film also shows Wakanda offering its technology and knowledge -- its literacy as black property -- to the rest of the world, showing a path forward from literacy being withheld from any group by another. </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>This is where I will discuss the impact of Black Panther, as a film specifically. I have several sources for this conclusion as well. This will also allow me to sum up much of my analysis, tracing the journey Afrofuturism has taken and Black Panther's place within it. Here, I will conclude my argument about how Black Panther manages to intersect and hit on issues of literacy from the past, through our present, and into an hopeful future.  .</p>
